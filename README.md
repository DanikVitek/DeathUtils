# DeathUtils
At the moment this plugin lets the player to get information of where did he/she died and to kill their character for any reason (survival and adventure mode only).

/suicide - kills the character\n
/remember - tells the last death location (it is saved in the file DeathUtils/death_coordinates.yml)

There might be futher updates for the plugin, e.g. config usage.
